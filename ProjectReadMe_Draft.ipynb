    "        - Further, I'd like to compare the role different services and their price play in the amount paid Monthly, as well as any role the average price of service for the elderly might affect the chance to Churn, since they typically require different types of services (ie. would including something like tech support on a senior plan help with senior churn [if senior churn is actually significant.])\n",

    "\n",
    "[MVP Hypothesis, the higher monthly charges and low tenure play a role in customer churn, as customers are more likely to leave if paying too much, and less loyal if they've not been a customer long. Contracts also play a role in how long a customer is mostlikely going to stay until they churn. Will have proper H0 and Ha Hypothosis later I hope!]\n",
